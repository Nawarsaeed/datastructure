In order to run all programs, you need to do the following steps

	1)First, navigate to the build folder using (cd build).

	2)Now you have to type the command (camke ..).
	3)last step, type command (make).

Now all programs is located  in the build folder. To run a program , type (./name_of_the_program). 	


Exercise 2: To solve the task, I have used the BFS algorithm. The table below shows how I thought to be 
able to navigate from the source (0) to the destination (5). 
To make it easier to understand, I have justified an image(map.png) that you can check out.
