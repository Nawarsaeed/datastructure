* An array is a random access data structure, where each element can be accessed
directly and in constant time.

* linked list is a sequential access data structure, where each element can be
 accessed only in particular order.
The differences between using linked lists or arrays for queues and stacks
are the following:
* The best reason to chose lists for implementing Stack is when you need a
functionality involving LIFO form and you are not sure how many
elements that functionality requires. So you would use Linked List creating 
nodes dynamically depending on the requirement.

Same goes for Queues. Implementing array based queue is better when it comes to
preform a functionality involving FIFO and you know the the number of
the elements that will be stored in the array.
The reason both are independent is because both follow different principles
LIFO and FIFO respectively.
