1) suppose that we have tow stacks A and B.
QUEUE pushes elements on B and DEQUEUE pops elements from A. If A is empty, so
the contents of the stack B are moved to stack A by deleting them out of B and
adding them to A. That way they appear in reverse order and are popped in the original one.

2) The DEQUEUE of stack can perform in O(n), only if the stack is empty.
   If many ENQUEUEs and DEQUEUEs are performed, so the total time will be
   linear to the number of elements.
